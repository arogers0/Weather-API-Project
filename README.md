# Weather-API-Project
This was part of a project for ECEG100. The program loops each hour, taking a value from the National Weather Service website for temperature and humidity of a given location. After one day, the program stops looping and will output a graph. 
### Running the code
Run `API_test.m` for one day. The computer will need to stay on and not sleep so that the code can run for this duration of time.
### Results
Look at `Real_weather_graph.png` for a graph of temperature and humidity data in Lewsiburg, PA outputted by the program.
